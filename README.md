# project_2019

Academic Mini-Project in Software Engineering.

designing and modeling a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene, 
with all the physics involved (light source, rays, reflections, 
refractions, color, occlusions etc.)

efactoring color calculation per Phongâ€™s model, light emission, and multiple light sources.
shadow rays and a support of occluded objects.
recursions - reflections and refractions, support for transparent objects.
Multiple reflection rays - glossy surfaces, Multiple refraction rays - diffused glass,
Multiple shadow rays - soft shadows, Multiple eye rays - super sampling (for Jagged edges).
optimization - stop reflection/refraction by reaching threshold.
